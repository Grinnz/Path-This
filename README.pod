=head1 NAME

Path::This - Path to this source file or directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Path::This '$THISFILE';
  print "This file is $THISFILE\n";

  use Path::This '$THISDIR';
  use lib "$THISDIR/../lib";

  # constant subs can be constant-folded by the parser

  use Path::This 'THISDIR';
  my $bar_path = THISDIR . '/bar'; # string formed at parse time

  # equivalent values resolved with only core modules
  # use constant or BEGIN to resolve __FILE__ as early as possible

  use Cwd 'abs_path';
  use File::Basename 'dirname';

  use constant THISFILE => abs_path __FILE__;
  # or
  my $THISFILE;
  BEGIN { $THISFILE = abs_path __FILE__ }

  use constant THISDIR => dirname abs_path __FILE__;
  # or
  my $THISDIR;
  BEGIN { $THISDIR = dirname abs_path __FILE__ }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exports package variables by request that represent the current source file or
directory containing that file. Dynamic or constant sub versions can also be
requested. Paths will be absolute with symlinks resolved.

Note that the package variable or constant sub will be exported to the current
package globally. If the same package will be defined across multiple files,
use the dynamic sub export so the file path will be calculated when the sub is
called.

For cases where this module cannot be loaded beforehand, the last section of
the L</"SYNOPSIS"> shows how to perform the same task with core modules.

See L<lib::relative> for the specific case of adding paths to C<@INC> relative
to the current source file.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 $THISFILE

=head2 &THISFILE

=head2 THISFILE

  print "$THISFILE\n";
  my $file = THISFILE;

Absolute path to the current source file. Behavior is undefined when called
without a source file (e.g. from the command line or STDIN). C<$THISFILE> will
export a package variable, C<&THISFILE> will export a dynamic subroutine (C<&>
not needed to call it), and C<THISFILE> will export an inlinable constant.

=head2 $THISDIR

=head2 &THISDIR

=head2 THISDIR

  print "$THISDIR\n";
  my $dir = THISDIR;

Absolute path to the directory containing the current source file, or the
current working directory when called without a source file (e.g. from the
command line or STDIN). C<$THISDIR> will export a package variable, C<&THISDIR>
will export a dynamic subroutine (C<&> not needed to call it), and C<THISDIR>
will export an inlinable constant.
